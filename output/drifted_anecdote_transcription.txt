 Hm hm hm, funny thing, when I was seven I made a boat out of mismatched toys and it sort of held together. Not that it matters, but building that way stuck with me. Quick fixes, duct tape elegance. So, when people ask about ownership of systems, I say I built parts of things, stitched services together, and occasionally owned a small feature. Sometimes I talk about entire projects, because it's simpler to tell a story than to read the commit history. It gets messy.
