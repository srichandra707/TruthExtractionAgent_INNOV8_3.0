 They applauded the demo, felt good. I usually say I drove the architecture because it's what people expect. 
 But behind the applause, I mostly copied patterns, reused scripts, and assembled other people's modules. 
 Once in a while, I told myself that stitching counts as designing. It's not a lie, so much as a convenience.
